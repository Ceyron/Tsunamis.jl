Future Trends in HPC Seminar - Shallow Water Equation Solvers with Julia

This is a translation of elements of the Shallow Water Equation code from
https://github.com/TUM-I5/SWE.

## Running the code

Make sure all dependencies are installed, then run

    julia single_node.js

for the single-node sequential implementation.
